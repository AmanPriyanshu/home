about_me=I am Aman Priyanshu, a Masters Student at Carnegie Mellon University, with a specialization in Privacy Engineering. My research interests include Privacy Preserving Machine Learning, Explainable AI, Fairness, and AI for Social Good. Currently I am researching under Professor Norman Sadeh for a Privacy Engineering Independent Study. I have recently focused on areas such as Prompt Engineering, Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, and Bias Mitigation. During my undergraduate studies, I was recognized as an AAAI Undergraduate Scholar (2023) for my contributions in the field of Fairness and Privacy. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to gain practical experience through internships, including working as a Privacy Engineer Intern at Eder Labs R&D Private Limited, a MITACS Research Intern at Concordia University, and as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Manipal Institute of Technology.$#SPLIT#$I have also had the opportunity to have several publications in the field of machine intelligence and security and have won awards for my projects. My explorations in technology are also extended to participating in hackathons, where I've applied my research to developing applications aimed at social good.
